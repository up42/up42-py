# up42

## up42 object

up42 is the base object imported to Python. It provides the elementary functionality 
that is not bound to a specific object of the UP42 structure (Project > Workflow > Job etc.).

From it you can initialize these other objects, get information about UP42 
data & processing blocks, read or draw vector data, and adjust the SDK settings.

To import the UP42 library:

```python
import up42
```
