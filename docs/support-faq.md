## **FAQ**

#### **I'm having trouble installing the SDK on Windows**

When working on Windows, we recommend installing the UP42 Python SDK via the conda package manager, see
the [installation instructions](https://sdk.up42.com/installation/) under `conda`. If you still experience issues,
please follow [guide 1](http://www.acgeospatial.co.uk/python-geospatial-workflows-prt1-anaconda/) or
[guide 2](https://chrieke.medium.com/howto-install-python-for-geospatial-applications-1dbc82433c05)
to set up your Python environment with Anaconda for working with geospatial libraries.

#### **Can I contribute to the SDK development?**

Yes, bug fixes and contributions are very welcome. Please see the [developer readme](https://github.
com/up42/up42-py/blob/master/README-dev.md) for further instructions.
