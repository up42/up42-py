    `up42` is the base library module imported to Python. It provides the elementary
    functionality that is not bound to a specific class of the UP42 structure.
    From `up42` you can also initialize other classes, e.g. for using the catalog, storage etc.

    To import the UP42 library:
    ```python
    import up42
    ```

    Authenticate with UP42:

    To initialize any lower level functionality use e.g.
    ```python
    catalog = up42.initialize_catalog()
    ```
    ```python
    project = up42.initialize_project(project_id="your-project-ID")
    ```
